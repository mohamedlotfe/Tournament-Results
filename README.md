# Tournament-Results
<h1>Project4: Tournament Results</h1>
You will develop a database schema to store the game matches between players. You will then write a Python module to rank the players and pair them up in matches in a tournament.
<br>
<h1>Why This Project?</h1>
Modern data-driven applications require developers that know how to store data and interact programmatically with that data. In this project, youâ€™ll design a database based off of a provided specification and use case and then write code that makes use of that data.

<h1>How Does This Help My Career? </h1>
.Persistent data is the key feature that turns static websites into dynamic data-driven web applications
.Properly establishing data relationships and using the appropriate data types ensures your applications perform efficiently and error free
